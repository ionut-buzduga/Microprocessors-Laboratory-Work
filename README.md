# Microprocessors-Laboratory-Work
These are the laboratories for the MicroProcessors Course


For the laboratory work under the Microprocessors course the following software/programming language were used:

-Simuide which is a  is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn
and experiment with simple electronic circuits and microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.

-Microchip Studio  which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and debugging AVRÂ® and SAM microcontroller applications. 

-C programming language in order to program the ATmega16A microcontroller.
